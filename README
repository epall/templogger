This is a tool for logging and graphing temperature sensors over time. It is
designed to receive data from some custom code running on a Dallas Semiconductor
TINI platform or a Web Energy Logger.

You're probably better off building your own solution with RRDtool
<http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/>, which I was unaware of when I built
templogger.

If you do want to use templogger, you're best off HTTP POSTing data to the
welpost.php script. It's pretty easy to reverse-engineer the format from that
source code. You'll also want to set up a logrotate rule on tinidata.txt that
looks something like this:

/users/home/epall/web/public/templogger/tinidata.txt {
        compress
        weekly
        rotate 1000
        create 0666 <USER> <GROUP>
        mail me@mydomain.com
}

The compression is required, as templogger assumes all older data is compressed.

The sundial branch is somewhat more developed, but it's also less tested.
